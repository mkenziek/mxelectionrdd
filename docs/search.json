    "text": "Turf wars for the control of drug trafficking corridors in Mexico have been associated with a lethal crisis of criminal violence in the country since the 1990s. After peaceful coexistence in the 1980s, six turf wars broke out between Mexico’s five major cartels (Tijuana, Juárez, Sinaloa, Gulf, and La Familia Michoacana) on the Pacific Coast between 1990 and 2006 (Trejo and Ley 2018). Annual turf war deaths reached 1,400 in 2006 (Trejo and Ley 2018). In 2006, the Felipe Calderón administration (2006-2012) began the first large-scale deployment of federal troops against the drug cartels, marking the beginning of the “Mexican War on Drugs” (Espinosa and Rubin 2015). To implement large-scale efforts to combat drug trafficking, the Calderón administration worked with PAN mayors and municipal police. The crackdowns on drug cartels under Calderón ushered in a dramatic spiral of violence (Trejo and Ley 2018). Between 2007 and 2012, more than 70,000 people were murdered in intercartel conflicts (Trejo and Ley 2018). For political context, Calderón was Mexico’s second National Action Party (PAN) president, continuing PAN’s control of the office after Vicente Fox’s electoral victory for PAN in 2000. Fox’s election as president represented the first opposition candidate to win the presidency of Mexico in recent history, ending the Institutional Revolutionary Party’s (PRI) hegemonic, 71-year-long rule (Trejo and Ley 2018). The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has historically represented a center-right platform with a broad base of support, while the National Action Party (PAN) emerged as a conservative opposition advocating for free-market economics and social conservatism (Foreign Relations 2024). Subsequently, President Enrique Peña Nieto (PRI) initiated reform efforts in 2012, which, although initially yielding decreases in homicides, ultimately fell short in tackling deep-rooted corruption and crime-related violence, culminating in a peak of 33,341 homicides in 2018 (Foreign Relations 2024). In response to widespread criticism of militarized approaches, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador a left-wing candidate of the Morena party, upon assuming office in 2018, vowed to shift towards civilian-led policing; however, despite the implementation of initiatives like the creation of a new National Guard, violence levels have persistently remained high, amplifying the challenges in governance, security, and anti-corruption endeavors (Foreign Relations 2024). Scholars have focused on identifying why intercartel violence in Mexico broke out in the early 2000s and estimating the causal effects of military interventions under Calderón on homicide rates in Mexico. According to (Trejo and Ley 2018), the rotation of political parties in state gubernatorial power in Mexico between 1991 and 2006 significantly contributed to the outbreak of intercartel violence and large-scale criminal wars. Their paper focused on analyzing the period from 1991 to 2006, prior to Calderón’s federal intervention. Trejo and Ley highlight the role of top- and mid-level officials’ removal from key state-level institutions, such as the state attorney’s office and the state judicial police, in disrupting informal protections for drug cartels previously provided under the one-party rule of the PRI. From its founding in 1929 to 1988, PRI had won every gubernatorial election in Mexico’s 31 states and nearly all municipal races. The study’s key finding reveals a 55.3% increase in violence in municipalities from states experiencing party alternation at the governor level compared to those under PRI hegemony, indicating a loss of cartel protection. Economic factors and organizational dynamics further strengthened this relationship. Further, time trend analysis suggests a surge in violence during the initial year of opposition governors, reflecting a disruption in government protection networks. Ultimately, Trejo and Ley’s “instability hypothesis” argues that when PRI lost power at the state level an informal network of cartel protection was thrown off leading to an outbreak of inter-cartel violence. Contrary to (Trejo and Ley 2018), Dell (2015) concentrates on the surge in violence following the Mexican government’s War on Drugs between 2007 and 2012, attributing the escalation to rival traffickers vying for territories after crackdowns initiated by PAN mayors, which diverted drug traffic and intensified violence along alternative routes. Dell’s “diversion hypothesis” posits that crackdowns in one area (i.e. PAN municipalities) lead to the diversion of drug activity and homicides to other regions without substantial reduction (Dell 2015). The key finding indicates that close PAN victories at the municipal level led to approximately 33 more drug trade-related homicides per 100,000 people annually during a mayor’s three-year term (Dell 2015). This analysis examines whether the success of the PAN candidate in Mexican municipal elections correlates with an increase in the post-election municipal homicide rate per 100,000 people, examining variations influenced by the rotation of political parties in mayoral office and the stability of PAN mayoral governance. Drawing inspiration from Trejo and Ley (2018), the study challenges the conventional notion of a separation between government authorities and organized crime groups (OCGs), aiming to explore the “gray zone” where these entities intersect through informal protection systems (Trejo and Ley 2018). Understanding how party alternation potentially disrupts state-criminal arrangements is crucial for grasping the broader dynamics of violence and governance in Mexico. Independent variables include the margin of victory for the PAN candidate, a municipal alternation index measuring party rotation, and a PAN power index gauging the stability of PAN mayoral terms. The dependent variable is the post-election municipal homicide rate per 100,000 people, encompassing all homicides, not just those related to inter-cartel conflicts. While prior research has provided valuable insights into the drivers of drug-related violence in Mexico, there remains a gap in understanding how political governance factors, particularly related to PAN governance stability and mayoral turnover, influence homicide rates at the municipal level after the war on drugs began in 2006 extending to 2020. There are two specific gaps that this paper seeks to address. First, earlier contributions, like Dell (2015), have focused exclusively on drug-related homicides which are defined as “any instance in which a civilian kills another civilian, with at least one of the parties involved in the drug trade” (Dell 2015). This paper uses general homicide rates to include deaths beyond the drug-related homicide definition. For example, instances of those killed in armed clashes between police and organized criminals and the deaths of undocumented immigrants who were targeted by drug cartels for profit during the war on drugs. This paper sees overall homicide rates as a better measure of the intensity of violence that emerged following the declaration of the Mexican War on Drugs. Second, while Trejo and Ley (2018) focus on the impact of party alternation in gubernatorial power on violence between cartels, this paper focuses on the impact of party alternation in mayoral power on municipal homicide rates zooming in on a smaller unit of analysis. Lastly, this analysis aims to make an original contribution to the research base by exploring whether the length that the PAN party held a mayoral office impacted municipal homicide rates."

    "text": "Empirical Extensions\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Municipalities that experience a higher rotation of political parties in mayoral office will observe a higher post-election municipal homicide rate per 100,000 people compared to municipalities with stable party governance.\nThe regression model for Hypothesis 2 (H2) is written as:\n\\[\n\\text{Overall Homicide Rate}_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1{Party Alternation Index}_i + \\text{Control Variables}_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Municipalities with a higher index of PAN power stability, indicating longer periods of PAN party governance, will exhibit a lower municipal homicide rate per 100,000 people compared to municipalities with lower PAN power stability.\nThe regression model for Hypothesis 3 (H3) can be written as:\n\\[\n\\text{Overall Homicide Rate}_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1{PAN Power Stability Index}_i + \\text{Control Variables}_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nHypotheses 2 (H2) and 3 (H3) provide empirical extensions that can help to rule out potential confounders of Hypothesis 1 regarding the causal relationship between PAN party victories and municipal homicide rates. H2 focuses on the rotation of political parties in mayoral office, drawing insights from Trejo and Ley (2018), who found that such rotations contributed to increased inter-cartel violence before the Mexican War on Drugs. By examining the impact of party rotation on homicide rates, H2 aims to differentiate between stable and unstable party governance at the municipal level. In contrast, H3 tests the opposite direction of Trejo and Ley’s hypothesis by exploring the impact of PAN power stability, specifically examining longer periods of PAN governance, on homicide rates. H3 considers the potential stabilizing effect of prolonged PAN governance, which may lead to lower levels of violence due to the implementation of effective crime prevention strategies and establishment of stronger institutional frameworks. Therefore, while H2 focuses on the destabilizing effect of party alternation, H3 considers the potential stabilizing effect of prolonged PAN governance. Although they approach the concept of political stability from different angles, both hypotheses contribute to understanding how political party dynamics affect municipal homicide rates, offering complementary insights into the relationship between stability and violence and helping to mitigate potential confounding factors like political stability and instability."
